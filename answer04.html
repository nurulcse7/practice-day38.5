    <h1>What Are Cookies?</h1>
    <p>
        Cookies are text files with small pieces of data — like a username and password
         — that are used to identify your computer as you use a computer network. 
         Specific cookies known as HTTP cookies are used to identify specific 
         users and improve your web browsing experience.</p>
    
    <p>Data stored in a cookie is created by the server upon your connection.
         This data is labeled with an ID unique to you and your computer.</p>
    
    <p>When the cookie is exchanged between your computer and the network server, the server 
       reads the ID and knows what information to specifically serve to you.</p>
